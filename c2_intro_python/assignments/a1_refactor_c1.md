# Refactor assignments from course 1

## Introduction

The course 1 numerical problem solving challenges gave you a taste for problem-solving with a programming language. This taste involved control flow, variable assignment, data organization, and computation. That said, it did little to challenge you in another, arguably more important, aspect of programming: abstraction. This assignment challenges you to abstract the code from course 1 so that your mild-mannered instructor can more easily wrap his head around your solution.

## Assignment

* Create a new git repository with the following structure

```txt
npd_c2_a1/
  original.py
  refactored.py
```

1. Select one solution script from the course 1 problem solving exercises, placing its contents in original.py
1. Create a new empty file called refactored.py
1. At the top of refactored.py, create a module doc string with the following
  * The main question your program tries to answer, written in English
  * The sub questions you need to answer to solve the main problem
  * The sub questions you must answer to solve each sub question
  * Continue in this vein until you have reached ideas you consider "primitive"
1. Now translate these questions into separate Python functions
1. Write a final main function called "main"
  * Takes no arguments
  * Combines your user-defined functions
  * Prints the correct answer to the terminal
1. Run this function

## Example

```python
'''Refactored exercise for some assignment in course

Question:
Find the difference between the cube of the sums and
the sum of cubes for the first 50 natural numbers

Sub questions
* What is a number, cubed?
* What is the sum of numbers?
* What is the difference between two numbers?
* What are the first 50 natural numbers?
'''

def cubed(number):
    '''Get a number, cubed

    :param number: INT an integer
    '''
    return number**3

def numbers_cubed(numbers):
    '''Cube many numbers

    :param numbers: LIST[INT]
    '''
    l = []
    for n in numbers:
        l.append(cubed(n))
    return l

def sum_numbers(numbers):
    '''Sum a list of numbers

    :param numbers: LIST[INT]
    '''
    return sum(numbers)

def first_natural_numbers(n):
    '''Return the first n natural numbers

    :param n: INT the largest natural number returned
    '''
    l = []
    for n in range(1, n + 1):
        l.append(n)
    return l

def difference(n1, n2):
    '''Return the difference between two numbers

    :param n1: INT the number from which n2 is subtracted
    :param n2: INT the number subtracted from n1
    '''
    return n1 - n2

def main():
    first_50 = first_natural_numbers(50)
    first_50_cubed = numbers_cubed(first_50)

    sum_first_50 = sum_numbers(first_50)
    sum_first_50_cubed = sum_numbers(first_50_cubed)

    cubed_sum_first_50 = cubed(sum_first_50)

    answer = difference(cubed_sum_first_50, sum_first_50_cubed)
    print(answer)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Challenge requirements

* Refactor as many scripts from course 1 as you can
