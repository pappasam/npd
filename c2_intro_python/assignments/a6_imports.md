# Packages and imports

## Introduction

Packages are a confusing, yet important, concept in any programming language. The best way to learn how they work is to work with an actual package, gaining exposure to various import strategies.

## Story

George, Paul, John, and Ringo have found themselves trapped in this Python assignment. They are trying to say something about their enjoyment of NYC, but unfortunately, the information they're trying to discuss hasn't been properly imported. Can you help them speak their minds and stop those terrible error messages from stifling their voices?

## Requirements

* Create a new git repository with the following structure

```txt
npd_c2_a6/
```

* Copy, recursively, the contents of ./src/a6 to npd_c2_a6/
* Allowed actions on the files contained in ./src/a6
  1. Create an empty \_\_init\_\_.py file
  1. Adding one or more import statements to the top of an existing file
* By performing the allowed actions, make ./src/a6/main.py run without errors. The following should print to your terminal:

```txt
George: Grr, I like New York City, New York in the US, and London in the UK, #$#@#!@!
John: Grr, New York City, New York is ok in the US, but for the UK, I dislike Luton, #$#@#!@!
Paul: Hello dear friend, love New York City, New York in US, love London in UK
Ringo: Hello dear friend, I truly hate Macon, Georgia in US, and really hate Luton in UK
```

* Commit the revised code to your repository
